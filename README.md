# CoinOp Connect
a PC to run an indefinite number of games.

Don't get me wrong!

If your genuine arcade cabinet shows a sign of PCB failure, this can be a solution to keep it running while attempting the PCB repair. Original hardware has to be preserved, and you can bet there's nothing more genuine than genuine hardware (Doh!!).

In this instructables I will introduce you to the PC to dedicated cabinet convertion procedure and associated challenges. I will describe the idea beneath CoinOp Connect, the functions it performs and it's circuits. I will give some pertinent information about the hardwares supported in this first iteration of the project and design choices I adopted. I will share gerber files to have CoinOp connect assembled at home with only little efforts on your side. I will share a first, generic, firmware set and describe it's functions.

Ok,ok, but which hardwares are now supported?

Supported hardwares/games are:

SEGA Outrun Hardware (Outrun, Turbo Outrun)
SEGA Super Hang-On (Hang-On, Super Hang-On)
SEGA X-Board (theoretically any game)
Atari System 2 (Paperboy, ABP: All Points Bulletin, Super Sprint, Championship Sprint, 720Â°)
Pole Position (Atari and Namco hardware)

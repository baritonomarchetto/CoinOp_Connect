Imagine that your beloved genuine arcade cabinet PCB has gone (spells allowed here!). You have three options in front of you: (a) keep it as it is for the time being, (b) wait months for a repair (c) convert it to JAMMA and use one of those commercial interfaces they sell everywhere nowadays.

Given that (a) is not a real option and (c) is deprecable (NOT ALLOWED!), only (b) is left. What if you don't want to wait for too long without playing your favourite game on your favourite cab?

Well, I think this Instructable may interest you :)

The JAMMA standard is with no doubt the most common in the arcade world and it is not surprising that commercial control interfaces to connect cabinets to a PC are all designed to support that specific standard. It was heavily used in generic cabinets, and sometimes in dedicated cabs too.

Unfortunately, biggest arcade cabinet manufacturers like SEGA, Nintendo, Atari and others did not adopt JAMMA and the fate of such non-JAMMA cabinets is often a "brutal" reconversion: emptied and rewired from scratch.

Definitely a deprecable, not respectful practice, if you ask me.

I am firmly convinced that we, tinkerers with a soft spot for the arcade world and free from business constrains should worry about remedying this situation. And, yes, we already are late to the party.

This is my small contribution to the challenge: an interface with the aim of simplifying the conversion of dedicated non-jamma cabinets, maintaining the original wiring. This interface allows the connection of a cabinet with a PC, keeping the operation completely reversible. This way one can roll back to the original game hardware without feeling "stupid" for having internally disfigured an amusement machine:P

For those reading the intro only, let me stress out a very importamt point: I am not suggesting you to replace your cab original game with a PC to run an indefinite number of games. Don't get me wrong!

If your genuine arcade cabinet shows signs of PCB failure, this can be a solution to keep it running while attempting the PCB repair. Original hardware has to be preserved, and you can bet there's nothing more genuine than genuine hardware (Doh!!).

Supported hardwares/games are:

- SEGA Outrun Hardware (Outrun, Turbo Outrun)

- SEGA Super Hang-On (Hang-On, Super Hang-On)

- SEGA X-Board (theoretically any game)

- Atari System 2 (Paperboy, ABP: All Points Bulletin, Super Sprint, Championship Sprint, 720Â°)

- Pole Position (Atari and Namco hardware)

Many thanks to those nice girls and guys at JLCPCB for sponsoring the manufacturing of this project's FR-4 PCBs. Without their material contribution I would probably never have developed the project.

JLCPCB is a high-tech manufacturer specialized in the production of high-reliable and cost-effective PCBs. They offer a flexible PCB assembly service with a huge library of more than 350.000 components in stock (included the MCP4728 needed for this project).

3D printing has been added to their portfolio of services so one can create a full finished product, all in one place!

# CoinOp Connect
Imagine that your beloved genuine arcade cabinet PCB has gone (spells allowed here!). You have three options in front of you: (a) keep it as it is for the time being, (b) wait months (years?) for a repair (c) convert it to JAMMA and use one of those commercial interfaces.

Given that (a) is not a real option and (c) is deprecable (NOT ALLOWED!) only (b) is left. What if you don't want to wait for too long without playing your favourite game on your favourite cab?

Well, I think this Instructable is for you :)

The JAMMA standard is with no doubt the most common in the arcade world and it is not surprising that commercial control interfaces intended to connect cabinets to a PC are all designed to support that specific standard. It was heavily used in generic cabinets, and sometimes in dedicated cabs too.

Unfortunately, biggest arcade cabinet manufacturers like SEGA, Nintendo, Atari and others did not adopt JAMMA and the fate of such non-JAMMA cabinets is often a "brutal" reconversion: emptied and rewired from scratch.

Definitely a deprecable, not respectful practice, if you ask me.

I am firmly convinced that we, tinkerers with a soft spot for the arcade world and free from business constrains should worry about remedying this situation. And, yes, we already are late to the party.

This is my small contribution to the challenge: a flexible interface for arcade cabinets to simplify the conversion of cabinets with non-JAMMA wiring by keeping everything still original.

For those who read the intro only, let me stress out a very importamt point: I am not suggesting you to replace your cab original game board and replace it with a PC to run an indefinite number of games.

Don't get me wrong!

If your genuine arcade cabinet shows a sign of PCB failure, this can be a solution to keep it running while attempting the PCB repair. Original hardware has to be preserved, and you can bet there's nothing more genuine than genuine hardware (Doh!!).

In this instructables I will introduce you to the PC to dedicated cabinet convertion procedure and associated challenges. I will describe the idea beneath CoinOp Connect, the functions it performs and it's circuits. I will give some pertinent information about the hardwares supported in this first iteration of the project and design choices I adopted. I will share gerber files to have CoinOp connect assembled at home with only little efforts on your side. I will share a first, generic, firmware set and describe it's functions.

Ok,ok, but which hardwares are now supported?

Supported hardwares/games are:

- SEGA Outrun Hardware (Outrun, Turbo Outrun)

- SEGA Super Hang-On (Hang-On, Super Hang-On)

- SEGA X-Board (theoretically any game)

- Atari System 2 (Paperboy, ABP: All Points Bulletin, Super Sprint, Championship Sprint, 720Â°)

- Pole Position (Atari and Namco hardware)
